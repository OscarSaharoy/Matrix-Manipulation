# Matrix-Manipulation

Welcome to Matrix Manipulation. This tool is intended to help visualise and understand matrix transformations in 2 dimensions. 

Left click the display to add a point, or right click one to delete it.

You can use the sliders to change values such as scale or rotation and view their effects on the points you have placed as well as see the matrix used for the transformation.

Extract the contents of this directory into a file, and run the matrix_manipulation.py script with python 3.6 or later.
